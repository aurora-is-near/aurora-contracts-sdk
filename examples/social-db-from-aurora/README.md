# `social-db` from Aurora

`social-db` is the storage layer backing [near.social](https://near.social/), a decentralized social media platform on the Near blockchain.

In this example we show how to interact with `social-db` from the Aurora EVM using the XCC feature.
In particular, we expose the [set method](https://github.com/NearSocial/social-db/tree/39016e654739b0a3e8cb7ffaea4b03157c4aea6e#storing-data) of the SocialDB contract to allow storing data in the DB from Aurora.
